# Pipeline workflow

End-to-end view of the data pipeline — sources, ingestion, raw layer,
transformations, marts, consumption, orchestration, CI. Status badges
(✅ / 🚧 / ⏳) make this file truthful as a snapshot of what exists
today, while still showing the planned arc.

> **How this file is maintained**
> - Update the status badge for a layer on the PR that ships it.
> - Avoids the "workflow doc says X exists but it doesn't" trap.
> - Companion docs: [`plan.md`](./plan.md) (week roadmap),
>   [`structure.md`](./structure.md) (folder layout),
>   [`adr/`](./adr/) (decisions),
>   [`../LEARNING_LOG.md`](../LEARNING_LOG.md) (weekly journal),
>   [`../LEARNING.md`](../LEARNING.md) (concept reference).

## Overview

The pipeline answers questions about contributor health and repo
activity from two complementary GitHub data sources. **GH Archive**
(every public GitHub event since 2011, hosted as a free BigQuery
public dataset) supplies the high-volume event stream. The **GitHub
REST API** supplies per-repo and per-user metadata snapshots that
enrich the events. Both land in BigQuery, dbt transforms them into a
star schema, and Looker Studio renders the dashboard. Dagster
(eventually) schedules the whole thing daily; GitHub Actions runs
`dbt build` on every PR.

## Layer-by-layer

### Sources                          ✅ partially
- **GH Archive** — `githubarchive.month.YYYYMM` BigQuery public
  dataset. Every public GitHub event since 2011. Queried directly
  via `_TABLE_SUFFIX` partition pruning; no copy of data.
- **GitHub REST API** — `api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}`,
  `api.github.com/users/{login}`. Daily snapshots of metadata only.
  ⏳ wired in Week 3.

### Ingestion                        ⏳ Week 3
- `ingestion/github_api_extractor.py` — pure Python module (no
  Dagster dependency, per [`structure.md`](./structure.md#ingestion--python-extractors)).
- Fetches a curated list of repos and users
  (`ingestion/targets.yml`), writes NDJSON to GCS partitioned by
  date, loads into BigQuery via `client.load_table_from_uri`.
- Rate-limit-aware via `tenacity`. Detailed plan:
  [`week-3-plan.md`](./week-3-plan.md).

### Raw layer (BigQuery)             ✅ partially
- `githubarchive.month.*` — external public dataset (we don't own,
  don't copy, read-only with pruning).
- `<project>.raw_github_api.repos`, `<project>.raw_github_api.users` — ⏳ Week 3.
  Partitioned by `DATE(ingested_at)`; loaded with partition-scoped
  `WRITE_TRUNCATE` so re-runs of the same day are idempotent.

### Staging (dbt)                    ✅ done
- `stg_gharchive__events` — one row per public GitHub event,
  deduplicated (GH Archive occasionally publishes duplicates),
  renamed and cast.
- `stg_github_api__repos`, `stg_github_api__users` — current build
  is placeholder-seeded; Week 3 swaps them to read from
  `raw_github_api.*`.
- All staging models are *views*. Light renames, casts, dedup only.
  No joins, no business logic.

### Intermediate                     ⏳ Week 4-5 (as needed)
- Ephemeral helper models for join logic shared across marts.
- Materialized as `ephemeral` per [`dbt_project.yml`](../transform/dbt_project.yml).
  CTEs, not materialized tables — they exist only at compile time.
- May stay empty if marts don't need shared helpers.

### Marts                            ⏳ Week 4-5
- `fct_events` — central fact, one row per event. Incremental
  materialization, partitioned by `event_date`, clustered on
  `(event_type, repo_id)`. Week 4.
- `dim_repos` — slowly changing dimension on the repo's
  star-bucket and archived status. SCD2. Week 5.
- `dim_users` — SCD2 on contributor tier (new / regular / core).
  Week 5.
- `dim_languages`, `dim_date` — simpler dimensions; `dim_date`
  uses the `dbt_date` package.

### Consumption                      ⏳ Week 7
- Looker Studio dashboard, public link in README.
- Declared as a dbt `exposure` in
  `models/marts/_marts__exposures.yml` so lineage points at it.
- Backed by a `mart_dashboard_*` table (or BI Engine) to keep
  per-query cost trivial.

### Orchestration                    ⏳ Week 6
- Dagster project under `orchestration/dagster_project/`. Currently
  an empty scaffold.
- Planned DAG: `ingest_repos → ingest_users → load_to_bigquery →
  dbt_build → notify`.
- Daily schedule. Slack/email/webhook alert on dbt test failures.

### CI                               ⏳ Week 6
- GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows/`.
- Runs `dbt build --target ci` on every PR.
- Uses a CI-specific target with a small `vars.gharchive_start_date`
  to keep PR scans cheap.

## Tracing a single row

Useful for orienting a reviewer who's never seen the project.

**Example event:** a `PullRequestEvent` on `facebook/react` from
2025-01-15 at 12:34:56 UTC.

1. **Source:** lives in `githubarchive.month.202501`, one row with
   `id = <some_int>`, `type = 'PullRequestEvent'`, `created_at = 2025-01-15 12:34:56`,
   nested `actor.id`, `actor.login`, `repo.id`, `repo.name`, `payload` (JSON).
2. **Staging view** ([`stg_gharchive__events`](../transform/models/staging/gharchive/stg_gharchive__events.sql)):
   the row is renamed (`id` → `event_id`, `type` → `event_type`, ...),
   flattened (`actor.id` → `actor_id`, `repo.name` → `repo_full_name`),
   and deduped (a `qualify row_number()` step drops the occasional
   GH Archive duplicate). `event_date` is derived from `event_at`.
3. **Mart** (⏳ `fct_events`): the same row materializes into the
   incremental fact table, partitioned by `event_date = 2025-01-15`.
4. **Dimension lookup** (⏳ `dim_repos`): joining `fct_events.repo_id`
   to `dim_repos.repo_id` (effective at `event_date`) yields React's
   star count, language, and archived status at that point in time.
5. **Dashboard tile** (⏳ Looker Studio): the row contributes to the
   "PR activity by language" panel — incrementing the JavaScript
   count for 2025-01-15.

The enrichment side runs parallel: every day, the ingestion module
captures fresh snapshots of `facebook/react` and the actor's
metadata. Those snapshots are what `dim_repos` and `dim_users` build
SCD2 history on.

## Update checklist (per PR)

When a PR ships a piece of the pipeline:

- [ ] Flip the relevant layer's badge from 🚧 or ⏳ to ✅.
- [ ] If a model name or schema name changed, update the
      layer's bullet list.
- [ ] If the change exposes a new tool or pattern, add a row to
      [`../LEARNING.md`](../LEARNING.md).
- [ ] Drop a journal entry in [`../LEARNING_LOG.md`](../LEARNING_LOG.md)
      (weekly batch is fine).
